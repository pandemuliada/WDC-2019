# GoNature - Politeknik Negeri Bali Web Design Competition 2019 Project

This project was created at Politeknik Negeri Bali Web Design Competition 2019, I forgot the theme because it's so long sentence. But as I remember the theme is related to _**"Go Green"**_. So related to the theme I build a website for ordering product that made without plastic materials. This project is static website. I was in the 3rd grade of Vocational High School and even though I didn't won the competition, I really happy because this is my last competition I've joined on my last year on school.
